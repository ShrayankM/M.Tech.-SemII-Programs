Normal text Give a text file as input to the program which contains plaintext.
Symbols     [!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (), _, -, +, =, {}, "", :;, ., /]
Numbers     [45, 5, 6, 0012, 90, (67-9-0999, $12,87,990)]

Design and develop your own encryption/decryption algorithm. Give a text file as input to the program which contains plaintext. 
Your program should write the output (ciphertext) in other file. If out put file is given as input your program should 
decrypt the message and should give you original plaintext back.
